					Counter-terrorism in Singapore
				</h1>
				<h4>
					Counter-terrorism in Singapore is a series of measures implemented in Singapore to detect and prevent terrorism, and to minimise damage from such terrorist acts should they occur. These measures involve all levels of society, including defence, internal security, border and infrastructure security, civil defence, medical readiness, and psychological preparedness. Singapore also participates actively in international counterterrorism efforts.

					The main terrorist threat to Singapore is from Jemaah Islamiah (JI), which has links to al-Qaeda and Abu Sayyaf. Jemaah Islamiah is known to have carried out the Bali bombing in 2002, which killed 202 people, as well as the Jakarta bombing in 2004 outside the Australian embassy, killing 11 people.

					After the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States, an informant revealed information to the Singapore Internal Security Department regarding Muhammad Aslam Yar Ali Khan, a Singaporean of Pakistani descent, who was a member of a group partnered with Al-Qaeda. Muhammad Aslam Yar Ali Khan was placed under surveillance by Singapore Internal Security Department, after which he left for Pakistan on 4 October. This man was captured by Afghan Northern Alliance forces in Afghanistan. His interrogation led investigators to more Jemaah Islamiah members in Singapore.

					On 9 December 2001, 13 suspects were arrested. Soon after that, a video found in an abandoned house in Kabul, Afghanistan showed a narrator in Singapore describing how to attack Americans using explosives. Investigators found similar tapes at the residences of the arrested men. In all, 33 men were arrested in relation to this plot. 
				</h5>
				<h5>
					In August 2002, another 21 members of Jemaah Islamiyah were arrested, demolishing JI's Singaporean cell. Arrests were also made in Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand. As of 11 November 2005, 36 alleged members of JI or the Moro Islamic Liberation Front were being detained under the Internal Security Act.

				However, Singapore believes that Jemaah Islamiyah remains active in Southeast Asia and is recruiting new members.

				</h5>
				<h5>
					On 25 August 2005, French investigating magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguière singled out Singapore along with Tokyo and Sydney as potential terrorism targets of the Al-Qaeda.  The Ministry of Home Affairs later responded that it had not received any specific information on imminent terrorist threat against Singapore, but added that security measures have been taken to strengthen security at borders, key infrastructure and iconic buildings

					Batam militants behind foiled Marina Bay plot jailed for terrorism conspiracy
				</h2>
				<h4>
					JAKARTA - Six Indonesian militants arrested for planning to fire a rocket at Singapore’s Marina Bay from Batam island have been sentenced to between three and four years in jail for conspiracy to commit terrorism.
					A panel of judges at a district court in Jakarta, led by District Judge Tarigan Muda Limbong, said on Wednesday (June 7) that although there was insufficient
					evidence to convict them for the plot to attack Singapore, the men were still guilty of other offences under Indonesia’s anti-terror laws.
					The alleged leader of the Batam terrorist cell, Gigih Rahmat Dewa, 31, was jailed four years for harbouring two Uighurs whom he had helped escape to Indonesia from Malaysia.
